Learning Objectives : 18th May 2022:

	- The basics of git
	- while loop
	- Use cases with while loop
	- List
	- Tuple
	- Set
	- Dictionaries


When to use for loop?
	- When the total number of iterations are known to the programmer then while loop should be used

	for condition:
		body of the loop
	else:
		false block of the loop

When to use while loop?
	- When the total number of executions is not known then while loop is used

	while condition:
		body of the loop
	else:
		false block of the loop

input a number 7859---> 9587


What is git?

	- Is Version Controlling System (VCS) or Source Code Management System (SCM)
	- Linus ---> The guy who invented (Conceptualized the concept) Linux OS 
	- Consists of some commands that can be used by the developers to manage their code

	- Bitbucket, Github, Gitlab etc -----> Same git commands

Without git?

	- Managing the different versions of the softwares was difficult
	- Reverting back to different versions was difficult
	- Was difficult to provide restricted access to each developer on their project


- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries are called data structures

Lists:

	- lists are created with []
	- Duplicates are allowed inside the list
	- Different data types can be assigned in a single array

	- list.insert(index, "Element")
	- list.append("Element")
	- list.pop()
	- list.count("element")
	- list2 = list1.copy()
	- list1.extend(list2)
	- list.sort()
	- list.remove("element")
	- list.clear()  ---> Clears all the elements from the list


Tuple:
	
	- Tupes are created with ()
	- Tuples are immutable (Not changeable)
	- The elements in the tuple are fixed
	- len()
	- max()
	- min()
	- tuple.index("element")
	- tuple.count("element")
	- tuple([list]) ----> Helps creating a tuple from a list

Set:

	- set.intersect()
	- set.union()
	- set.difference()
	- min()
	- max()
	- len()
	- set1.issubset(set2)

Dictionary:

	- dictionary[key]
	- dictionary.get(key)
	- newDictionary = dict(zip(key, value)) ---> To create a dictionary out of two lists
	- del dict["key"]
	-
