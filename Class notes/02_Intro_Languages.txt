Learning Objectives 27th April 2022 (Wednesday):
 
	- Basics of languages
	- Low level language
	- High level language
	- Compiler
	- Interpreter
	- Editor vs IDE



Languages:

	- Used to establish communication
	- Computers speak low level language
	- Human speak high level language


Low level languages:

	- The language that computers speak
	- Binary language
	- Machine language		
	- 0s and 1s

ASCII ---> American Standard Code for Information Interchange

A ---> 65
B ---> 66
:
:

a ---> 97
b ---> 98
:
:

delete ---> 0
space  ---> 32

High level language:

	- Human understandable languages
	- English, Khmer, Japanese, Tamil

Computers can't understand high level languages
Humans can't understand low level language

Assembly language:

	- There is a need for intermediate language to establish communication between Human and computer
	- Intermediate language for computers and human

Compiler:

	- A software that converts the source code into an intermediate code
	- Checks all the errors at once and provide the suggestion to resolve

Interpreter:

	- A software that converts the code line by line to machine understandable code


Python is used in:

	- Data Science                              ---> R
	- Machine learning
	- Big data
	- Ethical hacking
	- General programming
	- Graphical User Interface - Not recommended ---> Mobile app ---> XML with Java or kotlin, Swift
	- Web development - Not recommended          ---> Java, Java Script, PHP with laraval
	- Robotics
	- IOT
	- Scientific apps
	- Blockchain				     ---> Golang



Full stack development:


	Front end:
		- Html, CSS, Java Script ===> Bootstrap, Angular.js, React, Vue.js

	Back end:
		- Java, .net, PHP, Java Script (node)

	Databases:
		- MySql, Oracle, Mongo db etc...


Python:

	- Was introduced in 1991
	- Very old language
	- Became popular very recently
	- General Purpose Programming language
	- Object Oriented Programming Language
	- Very simpler syntax, a novice can easily implement his program
	- Python 3.X is the latest version of python
	- Python 2.X is still being used by companies
	- Python 2.X is pretty much different from Python 3.X
	- Python is an interpreted language (Executes line by line)
	- Python avoids boiler plate code (Unnecessary code)


How can I write python code?

	- Can be written with notepad++, VS VS Code, Atom, Sublime text, Pycharm, Python IDLE etc
	- Two types:

		- Editors:

			- Very light weight
			- Standalone software for writing programming code
			- Plugins can be added
			- VS Code, Sublime text, Atom etc

		- Integrated Development Environment

			- Very complex SW for developing apps
			- Integrated with different other required softwares
			- Very heavey weight
			- Pycharm - Jetbrains



---> Create a python file with the functions named:

	sum()
	diff()
	mul()
	div()


Reference:

def sum():
    num1 = 100
    num2 = 200
    result = num1 + num2
    print('Result : ', result)


sum()
