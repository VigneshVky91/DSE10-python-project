Learning Objectives 04th May 2022:


- Variables Intro
- Data types
	- Integers
	- Floating point
	- String
	- Boolean
- Storing student details into variables
- Inputting student details
- Type conversion
- Type checking
- Strings in Python
	- Single, double and tripple quotes
	- Accessing the string characters using indexing
	- Extracting characters from string (Using the colon :)
	- String methods:
		- Capitalize, Centered String, in, find, replace, Length of strings, uppercase and lowercase conversion

Variables:

	- Are temperary named memory locations
	- Their values can be changed


Examples of variables:

studentId = S123456
studentId = 3.14
studentId = "Vignesh"


int studentId = 12345;
studentId = 54321.56
studentId = "Vignesh"

var studentId = 5464
studentId = "Vignesh"


Type conversion:

	- It is possible to convert from any data type into a string
		- Eg. salary = 5000
		- str(salary)
	- Also it is possible to convert from a valid string into any other type
	- Make sure the value is proper

Checking types:

	- To check the types of variables the type() function is used
	- The type() function returns the type of the variable (Eg. str, int, float, bool)

Strings in Python:

	- Sequence of characters
	- Properly indexed
	- The index of the first element of the string always starts with 0 and ends with n-1
	- The first index can also be referred with index -n and the last index can be referred to as -1


Some builtin functions in strings:

	- capitalize
	- center
	- find
	- replace
	- upper
	- lowercase
