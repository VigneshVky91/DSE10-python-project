Learning Objectives: 25th May 2022 - Wednesday:

	Functions
		- Different types of functions
		- Passing arguments and returning values from the function
	arbitrary arguments *
	keyword arguments
	arbitrary keyword arguments **
	default parameters
	passing lists, tuple etc as arguments


What are Functions?

	- Collection of statements
	- Functions are created to reuse the code
	- Functions can be created once and called as many times as we want
	- Functions can have a name
	- Functions can receive arguments in the parameters
	- Funtions can return values at the end of all the statements

Task 1:

Create the function addTwoNumbers()
	- When the addTwoNumbers() is called it "must get input for two numbers" and "print the sum as a result"


#The below statements is called function declaration
def functionName():
	print("Hello world")
	print("Next line")

#The below statement is called function calling
functionName()
functionName()


arguments:

	- The values passed from the function calling to the function definition
	- Any number of arguments and types of arguments can be called to the function defintion
Eg 1.
def addTwoNumbers(num1, num2):
	print(f"Sum = ${num1+num2} Thank you for using the function")

addTwoNumbers(500,250)

Eg 2.
def printName100Times(name):
	print(name*100)


printName100Times("Sreng")
