Learning objectives:

	- Sorting techniques
	- Usage of sorting techniques
	- Bubble sort working mechanism
	- Code implementation
	

Sorting techniques:

	- Are used to sort the list items or array items

Types of available sorting techniques:

	1. Bubble sort
	2. Mergesort
	3. Quicksort
	4. Heapsort
	Etc


Bubblesort:

	- The most easiest and slowest sorting technique of all
	- The efficiency is very low compared to other sorting techniques
	- We try to sort the largest element in the list to its correct position (Right side of the list)
	- Then the next largest element to be places in its position
