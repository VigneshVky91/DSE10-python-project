File handling in Python:

	- The data used in python programs are volatile by default (Erased when the program closed)
	- It is needed to store the data into a permanent location
		- Databases (Mysql, Postgres, Oracle, Mongodb)
		- Files (Regular files --> Text data, Binary files)

Types of files used in python:

	- Simple text files
	- Binary files


Types of operations done on files:

	- Create (Creates a file specified into the memory)
	- Read (The python program reads data from the file)
	- Write (The python program writes data into the file - Erases the existing data from the file and writes the new data each time)
	- Append (The program writes data into the file - Doesn't erase the data from the file but appends the latest data into the file)

Tokens to open file in python:

x - Opening a file in Create mode
r - Opening a file for Reading
w - Opening a file for Writing (Existing data will be lost)
a - Opening a file for Writing (Existing data will be maintained)
rb - Opening a file for reading (For binary file operations)
wb - Opening a file for writing (For binary file operations)
rt - Opening a file for reading (For text file operations)
wt - Opening a file for writing (For text file operations)

To open a file in python:

	myFile = open("file_name.txt", "x")

os.path.exists()
